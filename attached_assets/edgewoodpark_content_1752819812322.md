Uri Kogan, Principal
I've led marketing teams at three high-growth B2B SaaS startups, after earlier experience at large, public technology companies.
At OnPlan, I built the marketing function from scratch, achieving a 3x YoY ARR growth rate while reducing cost per opportunity.
At Nuxeo, I created a new category of Product Asset Management, leading to a 12x ARR exit.
At AppZen, I led AppZen’s entry into the AP market and served as interim CMO.
Earlier, I led software marketing teams, incubated new services products, executed turnarounds, and led award-winning global supply chain initiatives at HP.
I have an MBA from Kellogg and undergraduate degrees in economics and opera performance from Northwestern University.
Our team
I have built a global network of talented product marketers, demand generation mavens, designers, SEO experts, website developers, and more. Based on your needs, I'll assemble the resources to deliver spectacular work.

## Testimonials

TESTIMONIALS
At Nuxeo, Uri he was instrumental in positioning the company in the Digital Asset Management space and in developing our enterprise DAM GTM strategy.
​
He is also very adept at learning new technologies and markets and rapidly establishing himself as a thought leader. Again, as an example, he was entirely new to the DAM market when he came to Nuxeo and, before long, was a go-to resource for the Sales and Marketing teams as a thought leader.
​
He is also very creative and productive and — as with our DAM GTM — knows how to develop positioning that will best differentiate the product. He works hard and is willing to get his hands dirty in producing content, going on sales calls, etc.
​
— Chris McLaughlin, former CMO and Chief Product Officer, Nuxeo
As interim CMO, Uri lay a strong foundation that helped me quickly establish myself when I joined AppZen as CMO. His transparency and clear understanding of marketing, the state of the product, and the opportunities and challenges across the business were prescient and helped me and my team deliver powerful results.
​
​
​
— Wendy Yale, CMO, DCVC
Uri delivered phenomenal work, growing our market awareness, and sharpening our positioning with a complete rebrand and compelling, high-quality content. He brought great passion to OnPlan.
​
His strategic marketing, product, and Board management advice was critical to our success, and his presence elevated our management team.
​
Uri's ideas and execution of better packaging helped us dramatically increase our selling price in just a few months and improve our implementation practices.
​
He brings exceptional communication skills and savvy. He elevated our thought leadership content, marketing offers, video and social efforts, and Board and customer presentations.
​
As a functional leader and key member of my executive team, Uri earned the admiration and enthusiastic collaboration of everyone he worked with and elevated our game.
— David Greenbaum, Founder & CEO
Uri is one of the best marketing leaders I've worked with.
​
He's an execution machine. He singlehandedly relaunched our product, building all the marketing from scratch — from collateral to website changes, ROI and benchmarking tools, and more. He  didn't stop with marketing; he also developed sales and service offerings.
​
Despite being new to our market, he became an expert and compelling spokesperson within a few months, and earned a high level of credibility that allowed him to build great relationships across product, sales, and services.
​
If I were looking for a strong marketing leader, Uri'd be my first call.
​
— Kuldeep Misri, Director of Product Management, Experience Cloud, Salesforce
Uri is a human dynamo - never before have I seen such energy and passion in one single person. But beyond that, Uri brings an additional level of technical excellence that allows him to create multiple layers of value to any organization he works with.
​
His detailed understanding of customer needs combined with his inbuilt analytical skillset created a robust platform for our marketing teams to build on. An accomplished speaker, writer, technical and product evangelist — there is little that Uri cannot do.
He has a keen sense of humor, an infectious laugh and a natural curiosity that is both engaging and endearing.
​
— Dave Jones, Founder & CEO
Uri was a central leader in our launch of new businesses combining software, services, and global distribution.
He also led our repackaging, positioning, and messaging efforts for a large portfolio of diverse industry offerings, enabling a global audience of sellers and delivery teams to succeed.

— Kash Kapadia, former Vice President and Worldwide Business Line Leader, HP
