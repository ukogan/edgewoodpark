                    <p>More recently, working at OnPlan, I had the opportunity to partner with John-Henry Scherck of Growth Plays. (Highly recommended!) He helped me marry the idea of mining existing attention with delivering a unique perspective that converts your audience in a way that really resonated.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are a couple of nuances to doing this effectively.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h2>How to win attention, and convert it</h2>
                    
                    <p>First, it's not that hard to find keywords to target. Lots of tools provide those. But once you've identified topics that have opportunity for you, you can't just write keyword heavy content that stinks. You might get some traffic. You might even win the battle for a page 1 rank, but then what?</p>
                    
                    <p>How many times have you clicked on a top search result, found the resulting page shallow and unhelpful, and bounced right away? A top ranking page can win the battle for your attention but lose the war for your business.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h2>Insight 1: What does Google reward already?</h2>
                    
                    <p>The first core insight is to carefully study what's already ranking for those keywords and figure out how to do a better job addressing the questions that are causing people to search than the pages already ranking.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h2>Insight 2: Google cares about all searchers</h2>
                    
                    <p>The second core insight is that you can't just answer the questions better for YOUR specific audience. You have to answer the questions better for the audience(s) that are searching those terms, AND for your audience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h2>A practical example from OnPlan</h2>
                    
                    <p>At OnPlan, we build powerful finance planning and forecasting software for CFOs and their teams. One of finance teams' planning challenges is properly forecasting and building scenarios around their workforce — how fast they'll hire, where, when, forecasting the costs of salaries, different benefits programs, different state taxes, etc.</p>
                    
                    <p>But if you Google "workforce planning" most of the content is very much aimed at HR leaders. What to do?</p>
                    
                    <p>We solved this in a few ways that varied depending on context.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h3>Address the most common questions for everyone, then focus on your audience</h3>
                    
                    <p>First, we'd acknowledge up front some of the key questions HR folks were asking about. We didn't spend much time becoming HR experts — not our fight to win — but we did point them to other resources (that hopefully weren't competing for the same keywords), so that Google understood that our page was on the path to their satisfaction.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another example where we did the same thing was "variance analysis". This is a very common task for finance teams, but it's also a standard statistical technique. Millions of college students search for information about how to calculate variance; Google cares about them even if they weren't in our target of finance folks.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both of these examples point to the same thing: if you want to be on page 1 of the search results, you very likely have to answer the questions that HR searchers / math students pose, while also answering the questions your constituency of finance pros cares about.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h3>Ok I got the ranking, but now my page has irrelevant info for my audience</h3>
                    
                    <p>If you've made Google happy, how do you make your particular audience happy? The key is to address key questions without distracting from your message.</p>
                    
                    <p>Next, we pivoted to our audience and provided them fantastic, expert-level content on the topic. A spreadsheet template, how-to guides, images, videos for some topics, and so on.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section fade-in-up">
                    <h2>When is this bad advice?</h2>
                    
                    <p>When is the advice above not useful? Going back to the original question, it didn't just ask about pages you want to rank at the top of Google Search. It asked about "marketing content" more broadly.</p>
                    
                    <p>A great way to make sure your page addresses the key questions a broad set of searchers are asking without detracting from content that's super relevant to your niche. There's of course a bunch of technical parts to this that lots of SEO tools and experts will talk about.</p>
